 # Project OverviewThis
   ASP.NET Core MVC project demonstrates essential features such as model binding, basic CRUD operations, user authentication, and role management.
   The project is designed to serve as a learning resource  for understanding how data is passed between controllers, 
   models, and views in an ASP.NET Core application, and how to implement role-based access control.
# Features :
  # 1. Model Binding in BindController1
   The BindController1 demonstrates how ASP.NET Core maps incoming request data to action method parameters.
  
  - Binding Primitive Types:
       Example: Bind/BindController1/TestPrimitiv?id=1&name=Ahmed&age=25
       Maps query parameters to action parameters (id, name, age, color).
      
   - Binding Collection Types:
        Example: Bind/BindController1/TestCollection?phones[home]=123456&phones[work]=789456&name=Ahmed
        Binds dictionary data (phones) and string parameter (name).
      
   - Binding Complex Types:
        Example: Bind/BindController1/TestComplex?id=1&name=Ahmed&age=25
        Demonstrates binding custom objects like the Department model

 # 2. CRUD Operations in DepartmentController
  The DepartmentController implements basic CRUD operations for managing departments:

  - Index Action:
      Fetches and displays a list of departments from the database.
      View: Index.cshtml renders the department list in a table.
  - New Action:
      Displays a form for adding a new department.
      View: New.cshtml provides the form layout.
  - SaveData Action:
      Handles form submission and saves a new department to the database.
      Implements validation for department name and assigns a default manager name if not provided.

 # 3. Employee Management (EmployeeController1) :

  The EmployeeController1 manages employee-related operations:

   - New Employee Form: New action loads a form with a list of departments.
     View: New.cshtml displays the employee form.

   - Save New Employee: SaveNew action validates and saves an employee record.

   - Edit Employee: Edit action loads an employeeâ€™s data for modification.

   - Update Employee: SaveEdit action updates existing employee details.

   - Employee List: Index1 action retrieves and displays all employees.

  # 4. Instructor Management (InstructorController1) :
  
   The InstructorController1 manages instructor-related operations:
    - Instructor List: Index action fetches and displays all instructors.
       - View: Index.cshtml lists instructors with details.
    - New Instructor Form: New action loads a form with department selection.
       - View: New.cshtml renders the form.
    - Save Instructor: SaveData action validates and saves instructor data.

 # 5. User Authentication (AccountController) :
 
   The AccountController handles user authentication, including registration, login, and logout.
     - Registration:
         ~ Register Action: Displays the registration form.
         ~ SaveRegister Action: Validates and saves a new user to the database, then logs them in.
         ~ View: Register.cshtml provides the registration form.
     - Login:
         ~ LogIn Action: Displays the login form.
         ~ SaveLogIn Action: Validates user credentials and logs them in if valid.
         ~ View: LogIn.cshtml provides the login form.
     - Logout:
         ~ LogOut Action: Logs the user out and redirects to the login page.


  # 6. Role Management (RoleController)
   The RoleController manages role-related operations and is accessible only to users in the "Admin" role.
   
   - Add Role: AddRole Action: Displays the form for adding a new role.
   - SaveRole Action: Validates and saves a new role to the database.
   - View: AddRole.cshtml provides the form for adding roles.

  # 7. Authorization and Claims (ServiceController)
   The ServiceController demonstrates how to access user claims and perform role-based authorization.
    - TestAutho Action: Checks if the user is authenticated and retrieves user claims such as NameIdentifier and custom claims like UserAddress.
    - View: Displays a welcome message with the user's name and ID.
    
  # 8. Database Migration (20250211084635_Autho.cs) :
   The project includes a database migration file (20250211084635_Autho.cs) that sets up the necessary tables for user authentication,
   including AspNetUsers, AspNetRoles, and related tables for managing roles, claims, and user tokens.   

   
# Views
  1. Index.cshtml
    Displays tables for departments, employees, and instructors with sorting and filtering options.
  2. New.cshtml
      Provides structured forms for adding new departments, employees, and instructors, with 
      dynamic data binding for dropdowns.
  3. Edit.cshtml:
       Allows modification of existing records while ensuring proper validation and relational data 
       integrity.
  4. LogIn.cshtml:
       Displays the login form with fields for username, password, and a "Remember Me" option.
  5. Register.cshtml:
       Displays the registration form with fields for username, password, confirm password, and address.
  6. AddRole.cshtml: Displays the form for adding a new role.
         
# Key Concepts 

  - Model Binding: Automatically maps request data to parameters or model objects in controller 
      actions.
  - CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality implemented in DepartmentController.
     View Rendering: Using Razor views to display and capture user input.
  - View Rendering: Using Razor views to dynamically display and capture user input, with support 
     for validation messages and AJAX-based interactions.
  - View Models: Using custom models like EmpDeptModel and InstDeptModel to pass combined data to 
     views efficiently.
  - Validation: Implements server-side validation using ModelState and client-side validation with 
     JavaScript to enhance user experience.
  - Database Interaction: Utilizes Entity Framework Core for database operations, ensuring robust 
     data handling and integrity.
  - Authentication: Implements user registration, login, and logout using ASP.NET Core Identity.  
  - Role-Based Authorization: Restricts access to certain controllers and actions based on user roles.
  - Claims-Based Authorization: Adds custom claims to the user's identity for more granular access control.
