# Updated Features
 1- Session and Cookie Management :
     The StateController has been added to demonstrate how to manage user-specific data using sessions and cookies. 
     This includes setting and retrieving session data, as well as managing both session and persistent cookies.

 2- Service Management :
     The ServiceController has been added to demonstrate dependency injection and service usage. 
     It uses the DepartmentRepository service to generate and display a unique ID.

 3- Repository Pattern :
     The project now includes DepartmentRepository and EmployeeRepository to abstract data access logic, promoting better separation of concerns and testability.
